# Data Analysis Exercises with Python

This repository was created to keep some data analysis exercises with public datasets. The codes here were developed in Python language, using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  

### License
The codes are available under GPL. That means you can download them, study them, change them, share them with other people, but you cannot, under any circunstance, using them in a commercial software, or make money with them. 

Thank you for visiting me. Have a nice day!
